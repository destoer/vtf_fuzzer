fuzzer for vtf files since a crashing exploit has been found for sprays (currently only messes with the header)
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Texture_Format

what looks it the game reading texture data out of some "random" memory
see current source for what appears to cause this
https://youtu.be/woM0CEJPG7c

this is done by setting zero frames with some bad dimensions and
it appears that spray displays the last texture (shows the flashlight texture  when its on)
maybye due to it not processing any new frames in the vtf and having old ones left in a buffer

it appears from the testing it using a spray known to crash that its something related the flags parameter
