fuzzer for vtf files since a crashing exploit has been found for sprays (currently only messes with the header)
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Texture_Format


css appears to accept sprays that are more malformed compared to tf2 and l4d2
it will even accept a completly zerod out header (causes crashes)


what looks it the game reading texture data out of some "random" memory
see current source for what appears to cause this

this is done by setting zero frames with some bad dimensions and
bump map scale and the reflect vector to zero
it appears that spray displays the last texture (shows the flashlight texture  when its on)
maybye due to it not processing any new frames in the vtf and having old ones left in a buffer
